               At the heart of our organization is the dedication to restoring and preserving the rich history of our Appalachian ancestors while ensuring the integrity of our mountain communities. Our co-founder, a native of Western North Carolina, has a deep-rooted passion for bringing aid and relief to the region, especially in the aftermath of the devastation caused by Hurricane Helen. We are committed to providing long-term assistance to families who have lost everything, many of whom are now displaced and homeless. <br></br>

               <br></br> For the families of these mountain communities, particularly those with children, the road to recovery has been an uphill battle. Countless individuals who had no insurance or were denied claims have been left with little hope. Even those who sought help from FEMA have faced barriers. That's why we are hereâ€”to fill that gap and offer the support they desperately need. We are devoted to helping these communities rebuild, providing homes, resources, and hope for a brighter future.
